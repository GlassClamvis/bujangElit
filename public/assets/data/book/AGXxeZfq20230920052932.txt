Qudit is a multi-level computational unit alternative to the conventional 2-level qubit.
Compared to qubit, qudit provides a larger state space to store and process information,
and thus can provide reduction of the circuit complexity, simpliﬁcation of the experimental
setup and enhancement of the algorithm efﬁciency. This review provides an overview of
qudit-based quantum computing covering a variety of topics ranging from circuit building,
algorithm design, to experimental methods. We ﬁrst discuss the qudit gate universality and
a variety of qudit gates including the pi/8 gate, the SWAP gate, and the multi-level
controlled-gate. We then present the qudit version of several representative quantum
algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, and the
phase estimation algorithm. Finally we discuss various physical realizations for qudit
computation such as the photonic platform, iron trap, and nuclear magnetic resonance.

INTRODUCTION
Qudit technology, with a qudit being a quantum version of d-ary digits for d > 2 [23]; is emerging as
an alternative to qubit for quantum computation and quantum information science. Due to its multilevel nature, qudit provides a larger state space to store and process information and the ability to do
multiple control operations simultaneously [106]. These features play an important role in the
reduction of the circuit complexity, the simpliﬁcation of the experimental setup and the
enhancement of the algorithm efﬁciency [100, 106, 108, 109]. The advantage of the qudit not
only applies to the circuit model for quantum computers but also applies to adiabatic quantum
computing devices [5, 166]; topological quantum systems [16, 37, 38] and more. The qudit-based
quantum computing system can be implemented on various physical platforms such as photonic
systems [60, 106]; continuous spin systems [2, 11]; ion trap [91]; nuclear magnetic resonance [48, 62]
and molecular magnets [99].
Although the qudit system’s advantages in various applications and potentials for future
development are substantial, this system receives less attention than the conventional qubitbased quantum computing, and a comprehensive review of the qudit-based models and
technologies is needed. This review article provides an overview of qudit-based quantum
computing covering a variety of topics ranging from circuit building [39, 61, 71, 89, 133];
algorithm designs [2, 17, 26, 62, 79, 119, 121]; to experimental methods [2, 11, 48, 60, 62, 91,
99, 106]. In this article, high-dimensional generalizations of many widely used quantum gates are
presented and the universality of the qudit gates is shown. Qudit versions of three major classes of
quantum algorithms—algorithms for the oracles decision problems (e.g., the Deutsch-Jozsa
algorithm [121], algorithms for the hidden non-abelian subgroup problems (e.g., the phaseestimation algorithms (PEAs) [26] and the quantum search algorithm (e.g., Grover’s algorithm

matrix.

[79]—are discussed and the comparison of the qudit designs vs.
the qubit designs is analyzed. Finally, we introduce various
physical platforms that can implement qudit computation and
compare their performances with their qubit counterparts.
Our article is organized as follows. Deﬁnitions and properties
of a qudit and related qudit gates are given in Section 2. The
generalization of the universal gate set to qudit systems and
several proposed sets are provided in Section 2.1. Then Section
2.2 lists various examples of qudit gates and discusses the
difference and possible improvement of these gates over their
qubit counterparts. A discussion of the gate efﬁciency of
synthesizing an arbitrary unitary U using geometric method is
given in Section 2.3. The next section, Section 3, provides an
introduction to qudit algorithms: a single-qudit algorithm that
ﬁnds the parity of a permutation in Section 3.1.1, the DeutschJosza algorithm in Section 3.1.2, the Bernstein-Vazirani
algorithm in Section 3.1.3, the quantum Fourier transform in
Section 3.2.1, the PEA in Section 3.2.2 and the quantum search
algorithm in Section 3.3. Section 4 is a section focused on the
qudit quantum computing models other than the circuit model,
which includes the measurement-based model in Section 4.1, the
adiabatic quantum computing in Section 4.2 and the topological
quantum computing in Section 4.3. In Section 5, we provide
various realizations of the qudit algorithms on physical platforms
and discuss their applications. We discuss possible improvements
in computational speed-up, resource saving and implementations
on physical platforms. A qudit with a larger state space than a
qubit can utilize the full potential of physical systems such as
photon in Section 5.1, ion trap in Section 5.2, nuclear magnetic
resonance in Section 5.3 and molecular magnet in Section 5.4.
Finally, we give a summary of the qudit systems advantages and
provide our perspective for the future developments and
applications of the qudit in Section 6.

2.1 Criteria for Universal Qudit Gates
This subsection describes the universal gates for qudit-based
quantum computing and information processing. We elaborate
on the criteria for universality in Section 2.1.1 and give examples
in Section 2.1.2.

2.1.1 Universality
In quantum simulation and computation, a set of matrices
Uk ∈ U(d n ) is called the universal quantum gate set if the
product of its elements can be used to approximate any
arbitrary unitary transformation U of the Hilbert space H⊗n
d
with acceptable error measured in some appropriate norm [153].
This idea of universality not only applies to the qubit systems
[47]; but can also be extended to the qudit logic [24, 39, 65, 102,
114, 164]. Several discussions of standards and proposals for a
universal qudit gate set exist. Vlasov shows that the combination
of two noncommuting single qudit gates and a two-qudit gate are
enough to simulate any unitary U ∈ U(d n ) with arbitrary
precision [153]. Qudit gates can themselves be reduced to, and
thus simulated by, sequences of qudit gates of lower-dimensional
qudit gates [135, 137] Brylinski and Brylinski prove a set of
sufﬁcient and necessary conditions for exact qudit universality
which needs some random single qudit gates complemented by
one two-qudit gate that has entangled qudits [23]. Exact
universality implies that any unitary gate and any quantum
process can be simulated with zero error. Neither of these
methods is constructive and includes a method for physical
implementation. A physically workable procedure is given by
Muthukrishnan and Stroud using single- and two-qudit gates to
decompose an arbitrary unitary gate that operates on N qudits
[118]. They use the spectral decomposition of unitary
transformations and involve a gate library with a group of
continuous parameter gates. Brennen et al. [21] identify criteria
for exact quantum computation in qudit that relies on the QR
decomposition of unitary transformations. They generate a library
of gates with a ﬁxed set of single qudit operations and “one
controlled phase” gate with single parameter as the components
of the universal set. Implementing the concept of a coupling graph,
they proved that by connecting the nodes (equivalently logical basis
states) they can show the possibility of universal computation.

2 QUANTUM GATES FOR QUDITS
A qudit is a quantum version of d-ary digits whose state can be
described by a vector in the d dimensional Hilbert space Hd [23].
The space is spanned by a set of orthonormal basis vectors
{|0〉, |1〉, |2〉, . . . |d − 1〉}. The state of a qudit has the general form

qubit as the basic computational element for quantum
algorithms. The state of a qudit is transformed by qudit gates.
This section gives a review of various qudit gates and their
applications. Section 2.1 provides criteria for the qudit
universality and introduces several fundamental qudit gate
sets. Section 2.2 presents examples of qudit gates and
illustrates their advantages compared to qubit gates. In the last

Here Uj,N and Zj,N are the N-dimensional analogues of Ud and Zd
such that Uj,N is applied to the jth eigenstate to produce |N − 1〉
and Zj,N modiﬁes the phase of |N − 1〉 by the jth eigenphase λj ,
while ignoring all the other computation states. According to Eq.

(x, y). Thus,
3, Uj,N can be decomposed with primitive gates Xj,N
Xj,N (x, y) and Zj,N are sufﬁcient to decompose U.
The second step is decomposing Uj,N and Zj,N . In other words,
Uj,N and Zj,N need to be decomposed in terms of multi-quditcontrolled gates. For convenience denote Cm [Rd ] as

and sgn represents the sign function.
Each primitive gate (such as Xd(l) or Zd ) has two free complex

is universal for the quantum computation using qudit systems.
One advantage of the qudit model (compared to the qubit
model) is a reduction of the number of qudits required to span the
state space. To explain this, we need at least n1  log2 N qubits to
represent an N-dimensional system in qubits while in qudits we
need n2  logd N qudits. The qudit system has a reduction factor
k  n1 /n2  log2 d. According to Muthukrishnan and Stroud’s
method in Ref. 118 a binary equivalent of their construction
requires a number of qubit gates in the scale of O(n21 N 2 ). By
analogy, the scale of the required qudit gates using the same
construction is O(n22 N 2 ). So the qudit method has a (log2 d)2
scaling advantage over the qubit case. Furthermore, in this

m-qudit space. It is proved in the appendix of Ref. 108 that
each Uj,N can be decomposed into some combinations of Cm [R d ]


and Cm [Pd (p, q)] where Pd (p, q) is the permutation of p〉 and q〉
state. The third step is using the two-qudit gates C2 [Rd ] and
C2 [Pd (p, q)] to complete the decomposition of Cm [Rd ]. Figure 1
shows a possible decomposition for d > 2. There are
r  (m − 2)/(d − 2) auxiliary qudits in the circuits (x denotes
the smallest integer greater than x). The last box contains Rd  Zd
or Xd(l) . Cm [Rd ] is implemented with these gates combined. All of
the three steps together prove that the qudit gates set

which is a d 2 × d 2 matrix that acts on two qudits. Rd acts on d
substates |d − 1〉|0〉, . . . , |d − 1〉|d − 1〉, and the identity
operation 1d2 −d acts on the remaining substates.
Now we work on an N  dn dimensional unitary gate
U ∈ SU(dn ) operating on the n-qudit state. The sufﬁciency of
the gates Xd(l) , Zd and C2 [Rd ] to construct an arbitrary unitary
transformation of SU(dn ) is proved in three steps. The ﬁrst step is
the eigen-decomposition of U. By the representation theory, the
unitary matrix U with N eigenvalues {λs } and eigenstates |Es 〉 can
be rewritten as

reviewed method, for an arbitrary unitary U ∈ SU(N), from Eqs
7 and 8 N eigenoperators is needed and each can be decomposed
with three rotations shown in Eq. 9. Deriving from the appendix
of Ref. 108; Uj,N can be decomposed with less than 3dn−1 multiple
controlled operations. Finally, as Figure 1 has shown, Cm [Rd ]
needs m number of C2 [Rd ] and C2 [Pd (p, q)]. Ud can be composed
with d − 1 numbers of Xd(l) as in Eq. 3. Therefore the total number
of primitive operations L in this decomposition method is
L ≤ 2N × 3d n−1 × n × (d − 1) + N × n ≤ 6nd2n + ndn .

{P[0]3 , P[1]3 , P[2]3 }. As an analogue of the standard
universal set for qubit {CNOT, H, T  π/8 − gate}, the qutrit
set generate the qutrit Clifford group whereas the qubit set
generate the qubit Clifford group (the deﬁnition of the Clifford
group can be found in Section 2.2.1). Whereas the rigorous
proof can be found in Ref. 38; the proving process follows the
idea introduced in Ref. 23 that the gate SUM3 is imprimitive,
and the Hadamard H3 and any gate from {P[0]3 , P[1]3 , P[2]3 }
generates a dense subgroup of SU(3). Similarly, the proposed
gate set for the qupit system is the sum gate SUMp , the
Hadamard gate Hp and the gates Q[i]p for i ∈ [p − 1]. The
proof is analogous to that of the qutrit set. The Hadamard
Hp and the Q[i] gates are combined to form a dense subgroup of
SU(p) and SUMp is shown to be imprimitive. Implementing
Theorem 1.3 in Ref. 23; the set is a universal gate set. These
universal gate sets for the qudit systems, with fewer numbers of
gates in each set compare to that in the previous examples, have
the potential to perform qudit quantum algorithms on the
topological quantum computer.

(12)

It is clear that there is an extra factor of n reduction in the gate
requirement as the number scale of this method is O(nN 2 ). The
other advantage is these primitive qudit gates can be easily
implemented with fewer free parameters [108].
For qudit quantum computing, depending on the
implementation platform, other universal quantum gate sets
can be considered. For example, in a recent proposal for
topological quantum computing with metaplectic anyons, Cui
and Wang prove a universal gates set for qutrit and qupit systems,
for a qupit being a qudit with p dimensions and p is an prime
number larger than 3 [38]. The proposed universal set is a qudit
analogy of the qubit universal set and it consists several
generalized qudit gates from the universal qubit set.

2.2 Examples of Qudit Gates
In this section we introduce the qudit versions of many important
quantum gates and discuss some of the gates’ advantages
compared to their qubit counterparts. The gates discussed are
the qudit versions of the π/8 gate in Section 2.2.1, the SWAP gate
in Section 2.2 and the multi-level controlled gate in Section 2.2
In Section 2.2.3, we also introduce how to simplify the qubit
Toffoli gate by replacing one of the qubit to qudit. This gives ideas
about improving the qubit circuits and gates by introducing
qudits to the system.

where

2.2.1 Qudit Versions π/8 Gate
The qubit π/8 gate T has an important role in quantum
computing and information processing. This gate has a wide
range of applications because it is closely related to the Clifford
group but does not belong to the group. From the GottesmanKnill theorem [64] it is shown that the Clifford gates and Pauli
measurements only do not guarantee universal quantum
computation (UQC). The π/8 gate, which is non-Clifford and
from the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, is the essential gate
to obtaining UQC [20]. This gate can be generalized to a d
dimensional qudit system, where, throughout the process, d is
assumed to be a prime number greater than 2 [71].
To deﬁne the Clifford group for a d-dimensional qudit space,
we ﬁrst deﬁne the Pauli Z gate and Pauli X gate. The Pauli Z gate
and Pauli X gate are generalized to d dimension in the matrix
forms [11, 67, 124, 130].

The SUMd gate serves as a natural generalization of the CNOT
gate
SUMd |i, j〉  |i, i + j(modd)〉, i, j ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , d − 1}.

(15)

The Pauli σ z , with the π/8 gate as its 4th root, can be generalized to
Q[i] gates for qudits,

In general Q[i]p is always a power of P[i]p if p is an odd prime.
The proposed gate set for the qutrit system is the sum gate
SUM3 , the Hadamard gate H3 and any gate from the set

many applications and utilities in teleportation-based UQC [66];

generalized qudit version of the π/8 gate, Uυ , is shown to be
identical to the maximally robust qudit gates for qudit faulttolerant UQC discussed in reference [150].
This gate also plays an important role in the magic-state
distillation (MSD) protocols for general qudit systems, which
was ﬁrst established for qutrits [6] and then extended to all primedimensional qudits [25].

2.2.3 Simpliﬁed Qubit Toffoli Gate With a Qudit
The Toffoli gate is well known for its application to universal
reversible classical computation. In the ﬁeld of quantum
computing, the Toffoli gate plays a central role in quantum
error correction [35]; fault tolerance [43] and offers a simple
universal quantum gate set combined with one qubit Hadamard
gates [141]. The simplest known qubit Toffoli gate, shown in
Figure 5, requires at least ﬁve two-qubit gates [125]. However, if
the target qubit has a third level, i.e., a qutrit, the whole circuit can
be achieved with three two-qubit gates [133].
A new qutrit gate Xa is introduced to the circuit that does the
following: Xa |0〉  |2〉 and Xa |2〉  |0〉 with Xa |1〉  |1〉. The
simpliﬁed circuit is shown in Figure 6. The two controlled gates
are the CNOT gate and a control-Z gate, which is achieved with a
CNOT gate between two Hadamard gates. The Hadamard gate
here operating on the qutrit is generalized from the normal
Hadamard gate operating on a√qubit—it only works √
with the
|0〉 and |1〉, such that H|0〉  1/ 2[|0〉+|1〉], H|1〉  1/ 2[|0〉 |1〉] and H|2〉  |2〉. Comparing the circuit in Figure 6 to that in
Figure 5, it is clear that the total number of gates is signiﬁcantly
reduced.
This method can be generalized to n-qubit-controlled Toffoli
gates by utilizing a single (n + 1)-level target carrier and using
only 2n − 1 two-qubit gates [133]. In other words, the target
carrier needs an extra level for each extra control qubit. Compare
to the best known realization previously that requires 12n − 11

(50)

where dp ≤ dmin  min(dc , dt ).
In the rest of this section, we present a Hermitian
generalization of the qudit CNOT gate with a symmetry
conﬁguration and a qudit SWAP circuit with a single type of
qudit gate as shown in Figure 4A [61]. Compared with all the
previously proposed SWAP gate for qudit, this method is easier to

For the proposed SWAP gate, both the QFT and CZd operations
are realizable on a multilevel quantum systems. For example,
there are implementations of them for multilevel atoms [118,
145]. The resulting SWAP gate provides a way to connect systems
limited to the nearest-neighbour interactions. This gate provides
a useful tool in the design and analysis of complex qudit circuits.

However, this SWAP gate needs to be corrected with an Kd [4] as
shown in Figure 3. A partial SWAP gate Sp [39] works on a

fulﬁlled, the n-qubit Toffoli gate can be realized by 2n − 3 twoqudit CZ gates. The detailed realization of the n-qubit Toffoli gate
by the properties and special operations of the tree in topology
can be found in Ref. 89. The advantage of this scheme is the
scalability and the ability to implement it for the multi-qubit
controlled unitary gate Cn U.
These Cn U gates are a crucial component in the PEA which
has many important applications such as the quantum simulation
[8] and Shor’s factoring algorithm [142]. This idea of combining
qudits of different dimensions or hybrid qudit gates can also be
applied to other qudit gates such as the SWAP and SUM gates as
shown in Refs. [33, 39]. Thus, introducing qudits into qubit
systems to create a hybrid qudit system offers the potential of
improvement to quantum computation.

2.2.4 Qudit Multi-Level Controlled Gate
For a qubit controlled gate, the control qubit has only two states
so it is a “do-or-don’t” gate. Qudits, on the other hand, have
multiple accessible states and thus a qudit-controlled gate can
perform a more complicated operation [46]. The MuthukrishanStroud gate (MS gate) for a qudit applies the speciﬁed operation
on the target qudit only if the control qudit is in a selected one of
the d states, and leaves the target unchanged if the control qudit is
in any other d − 1 states. Hence, the MS gate is essentially a “door-don’t” gate generalized to qudits and does not fully utilize the d
states on the control qudit [118].
To fully utilize the d states on the control qudit, people have
developed the quantum multiplexer to perform the controlled U
operations in a qudit system as shown in Figure 7, where the MS
gate and shifting gates are combined to apply different operations
to the target depending on different states on the control states
[87]. Here we discuss the multi-value-controlled gate (MVCG) for
qudits, which applies a unique operation to the target qudit for
each unique state of the control qudit [106].
For a d-dimensional qudit system, a two-qudit multi-valuecontrolled gate is represented by a d2 × d 2 matrix

two-qubit gates [125]; this method offers a signiﬁcant resource
reduction. Furthermore, these schemes can be extended to more
general quantum circuits such as the multi-qudit-controlledunitary gate Cn U.
The previous method turns the target qubit into a qudit;
another method simpliﬁes the Toffoli gate by using only
qudits and treating the ﬁrst two levels of the qudit as qubit
levels and other levels as auxiliary levels. The reduction in the
complexity of Toffoli gate is accomplished by utilizing the
topological relations between the dimensionality of the qudits,
where higher qudit levels serve as the ancillas [89].
Suppose we have a system of n qudits denoted as
Qi , i ∈ {1, . . . , n} and each qudit has dimension di ≥ 2. Qudits
are initialized into pure or mix states on the ﬁrst two levels,
i.e., the qubit states, and zero population for the other levels,
i.e., the auxiliary states. This scheme assumes the ability to
perform single-qubit operations. We can apply the desirable
unitary operation on the qubit states and leave the auxiliary
states unchanged. We also assume that we have the ability to
manipulate the auxiliary levels by a generalized inverting gate Xm
Xm |0〉  |m〉, Xm |m〉  |0〉, Xm |y〉  |y〉, for y ≠ m, 0.

At the same time, the two-qubit CZ gates are applied according to
certain topological connections between qudits. We introduce a
set E of ordered pairs (i, j), such that i, j ∈ {1, . . . , n}, i < j to
obtain this topology and the CZ gate is deﬁned as

with x ∈ {0, . . . di − 1} and y ∈ {0, . . . dj − 1}.

The set E describes an n-vertex-connected graph. Let E4E
deﬁnes an n-vertex connected tree (acyclic graph). The main
result is: the n-qubit Toffoli gate can be achieved with less number
of operations if

(64)

Here, diag represents the diagonal matrix, 0d−2j denotes the zeros
of length d − 2j. udjk are traceless and Hermitian and together with
the identity matrix 1d serve as the basis of the vector space of
d × d Hermitian matrix. These generalized Gell-Mann matrices
can be used to generate the group representation of SU(d) while
the other representations can be achieved by transform these
matrices uniformly. To derive the bases of SU(dn ), we ﬁrst deﬁne
xl  udjk with l  jd + k, l ∈ [d 2 ] and

quantum information is lost due to the outside perturbations and
noises. In the computation process, quantum gates take certain
amount of time to alter the states of the qudits. The decoherence
time of a qudit state limits the number of quantum gates in the
circuit. Therefore, we need to design more efﬁcient algorithms
and circuits. A method exists to do a general systematic
evaluation of the circuit efﬁciency with the mathematical
techniques of Riemannian geometry [126]. By reforming the
quantum circuits designing problems as a geometric problem,
we are able to develop new quantum algorithms or to exploring
and evaluating the full potential of the quantum computers. This
evaluation is able to generalized to qutrit systems, where the least
amount of the gates required to synthesize any unitary operation
is given [100].
To begin with, we assume that the operations done by the
quantum circuit can be described by a unitary evolution U
derived from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation dU/dt 
−iHU with the boundary condition tf , U(tf )  U. The complexity
of realizing U can be characterized by a cost function F[H(t)] on
the Hamiltonian control H(t). This allow us to deﬁne a
Riemannian geometry on the space of unitary operations
[122]. Finding the minimal geodesics of this Riemannian
geometry is equivalent to ﬁnding the optimal control function
H(t) of synthesizing the desired U.
Now we transform the problem of calculating a lower bound to
the gate number to ﬁnding the minimal geodesic distance
between the identity operation I and U. Instead of Pauli
matrices for the qubit representation of the Hamiltonian, the
qutrit version of Hamiltonian is expanded in terms of the GellMann matrices. Here we give an explicit form of the Gell-Mann
matrices representation in d-dimension [109] which is used for
qutrit (where d  3) as well as other qudit systems in the later part

YtP denotes all operators with generalized Gell-Mann matrices

break up the constant ε to an explicit form, we have ε−2  N 2 d4 n2 ,
where d is the dimension of the qudit, n is the number of qudits
and N is the number of the intervals that d(I, U) divides into,
such that a small δ  d(I, U)/N ≤ ε. The qudit case shows the
explicit relation between the non-local quantum gate cost and the
approximation error for synthesizing quantum qudit operations.
In summary, for the quantum circuit model, one can decide a
lower bound for the number of gates needed to synthesize U by
ﬁnding the shortest geodesic curve linking I and U. This provides
a good reference for the design of the quantum circuit using
qudits.

process a larger amount of information than a qubit. Some of the

multi-dimensional nature of the qudit at the key subroutine of the
process. This section introduces examples of the well-known

efﬁcient algorithms for solving the oracle decision problems,
which are quite important historically and used to
demonstrate the classical-quantum complexity separation [44,
45]. The oracle decision problems is to locate the contents we
want from one of the two mutually disjoint sets that is given. We
start in Section 3.1.1 with a discussion about a single-qudit
algorithm that determines the parity of a permutation. In
Section 3.1.2, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in qudit system is
discussed and its unique extension, the Bernstein-Vazirani
algorithm is provided in Section 3.1.3.

where H is the mean Hamiltonian. Lastly, for H as an n-qutrit
one- and two-body Hamiltonian, a unitary operator UA exists
that satisﬁes


− UA  ≤ c2 n2 Δ3
(73)
e
and can be generated with at most c1 n2 / Δ one- and two-qutrit
gates, and constants c1 and c2 .
All these lemmas combined gives the ﬁnal theorem for the
qutrit system: for a unitary operator U in SU(3n ), O(nk d(I, U)3 )
one- and two-qutrit gates is the lower bound to synthesize a
unitary UA with the condition ||U − UA || ≤ c, given a constant c. It
is worth mentioning that for any groups of unitaries U, which is
labeled by the number of qudits n, the ﬁnal theorem shows a
quantum circuit exists with a polynomial of d(I, U) number of
gates such that it can approximates U to arbitrary accuracy.
Alternatively,a polynomial-sized quantum circuit exists if and
only if the distance d(I, U) itself is scaling polynomially with n.
With appropriate modiﬁcation, the Riemannian geometry
method can be used to ascertain the circuit-complexity bound
for a qudit system [109]. In this scheme, the unitary matrix
U ∈ SU(dn ) is represented by the generalized Gell-Mann
matrices as deﬁned in the earlier part of the section. The main
theorem in the qudit case of the Ref. [109] is “for any small

3.1.1 Parity Determining Algorithm
In this section we review a single qutrit algorithm which provides
a two to one speedup than the classical counterpart. This
algorithm can also be generalized to work on an arbitrary
d-dimensional qudit which solves the same problem of a
larger computational space [62]. In quantum computing,
superposition, entanglement and discord are three important
parts for the power of quantum algorithms and yet the full
picture behind this power is not completely clear [151].
Recent research shows that we can have a speedup in a fault
tolerant quantum computation mode using the quantum
contextuality [72]. The contextual nature can be explained as
“a particular outcome of a measurement cannot reveal the preexisting deﬁnite value of some underlying hidden variable” [92,

93]. In other words, the results of measurements can depend on
how we made the measurement, or what combination of
measurements we chose to do. For the qudit algorithm
discussed below, a contextual system without any quantum
entanglement is shown to solve a problem faster than the
classical methods [62]. Because this qudit algorithm uses a
single qudit throughout the process without utilizing any
correlation of quantum or classical nature, it acts as a perfect
example to study the sources of the quantum speed-up other than
the quantum correlation.
The algorithm solves a black-box problems that maps d inputs
to d outputs after a permutation. Consider the case of three
objects where six possible permutations can be divided into two
groups: even permutation that is a cyclic change of the elements
and odd permutation that is an interchange between two
elements. If we deﬁne a function f (x) that represents the
permutation on the set x ∈ {−1, 0, 1}, the problems become
determining the parity of the bijection f : −1, 0, 1 → −1, 0, 1.

element m ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}. As f (p)  f (q) if p ≡ q(mod n),
each of the elements in the codomain {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} is mapped
to nr−1 different elements in the domain. To ﬁnish the proof of the
n-nary Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, another trivial lemma is needed:
αk
Primitive nth roots of unity satisfy '​ n−1
k0 ω  0 for nonzero
integers α.
The circuit of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in qudits is shown
in Figure 9. This algorithm of r qudits can both distinguish
whether a function Uf is balanced or constant and verify a closed
expression for an afﬁne function in Uf within a constant term
which is a universal phase factor of the x-register and thus is lost
during the measurement. The other coefﬁcients of the afﬁne
function A1 , . . . , Ar are determined by measuring the state of the
x-register at the output, |A1 , . . . , Ar 〉.
A detailed derivation of the circuit has been shown [53]; but
the reasoning is an analogy to the qubit version of the DeutschJozsa algorithm. If the function Uf is constant, the ﬁnal state after
the measurement is |0〉⊗r |n − 1〉 as for j ≠ 0 every states in the
x-register have null amplitudes. Therefore, if every x-register
qudit yields |0〉, it is a constant function; otherwise the
function is balanced.
The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm in the qudit system shares the
same idea while enabling more applications such as
determining the closed form of an afﬁne function. Although
this algorithm is mainly of theoretical interest, the n-nary
version of it may have applications in image processing. It
has the potential to distinguish between maps of texture in a
Marquand chart since the images of which are encoded by
afﬁne functions [121]. This algorithm can also be modiﬁed to
set up a secure quantum key-distribution protocol [121]. Other
proposed Deutsch-Jozsa algorithms exist such as a method that
makes use of the artiﬁcially allocated (subsystems) as qudits
[88] and a generalized algorithm on the virtual spin
representation [86].

(79)

In this scenario, a positive cyclic permutation maps |ψ 2 〉 onto
itself whereas negative permutations give |ψ d 〉. We then measure
the results after applying an inverse Fourier transform to solve for
the parity of the permutation. This algorithm has been
implemented on the NMR system for both the qutrit [48] and
quart [62] cases. It is also realized on a linear optic system [163].
Although the model problem has no signiﬁcant applications and
the speedup in the higher dimensional cases is not exponential,
this proposed algorithm provides an elegant yet simple example
for quantum computation without entanglement.

3.1.2 Qudit Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
Deutsch algorithm (with its origin in Ref. 44 and improved in Ref.
33 is one of the simplest examples to show the speed advantage of
quantum computation. Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm is n-qubits
generalization of the Deutsch algorithm. Deutsch-Jozsa
algorithm can determine if a function f (x) is constant, with
constant output, or balanced, that gives equal instances of both
outputs [125]. The process itself consists of only one evaluation of
the function f (x). In this algorithm, Alice sends Bob N qubits in
the query register and one in the answer register where Bob
applies the function to the query register qubits and stores the
results in the answer register. Alice can measure the qubits in the
query register to determine whether Bob’s function is constant or
balanced. This algorithm makes use of the superposition property
of the qubit and reduces the minimum number of the function
call from 2n /2 + 1 classically to only 1 with quantum algorithm.
This gives another example of the advantages of quantum
algorithms.
The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can be performed in the qudit
system with a similar setup. Furthermore, with the qudit system,
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm can also ﬁnd the closed expression of an
afﬁne function accurate to a constant term [53]. The constant and
balanced function in the n dimensional qudit case have the
following deﬁnition: “An r-qudit multi-valued function of the
form
f : {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}r

→ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}

3.1.3 Qudit Generalization of the Bernstein-Vazirani
Algorithm
In Section 3.1.2 we have discussed an application of a qudit
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm (DJA): verify a closed expression of an
afﬁne function. This application is closely related to the
Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm discussed in this section. Given
an input string and a function that calculates the bit-wize innerproduct of the input string with an unknown string, the
Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm determines the unknown string
[12]. This algorithm can be treated as an extension of the
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.
The qudit generalization of the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm
can determine a number string of integers modulo d encoded in
the oracle function [95, 119]. First we introduce a positive integer
d and consider the problem in modulo d throughout. Given an
N-component natural number string

(80)

is constant when f (x)  f (y) ∀x, y ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}r and is
balanced when an equal number of the nr domain values,
namely nr−1 , is mapped to each of the n elements in the codomain” [53].
It can be shown that all of the afﬁne functions of r qudits
f (x1 , . . . , xr ) : A0 ⊕ A1 x1 ⊕ /⊕ Ar xr , A0 , . . . , Ar ∈ Zn ,

(81)

g(a) : g(a1 ), g(a2 ), g(a3 ), . .. , g(aN ), g(aj ) ∈ {0, 1, . .. , d − 1},

can be categorized to either constant or balanced functions [53].
If all the coefﬁcients Ai ≠ 0  0 then the function is constant. For
afﬁne function with non-zero coefﬁcient Ai ≠ 0 , every element in
its domain {0, 1, . . . , n − 1}r is reducible modulo n to a unique

3.2.2 Phase-Estimation Algorithm With Qudits
With the qudit quantum Fourier transform, we are able to
generalize the PEA to qudit circuits [26]. Similar to the PEA
using qubit, the PEA in the qudit system is composed by two
registers of qudits. The ﬁrst register contains t qudits and t
depends on the accuracy we want for the estimation. We
assume that we can perform a unitary operation U to an
arbitrary number of times using qudit gates and generate its
eigenvector |u〉 and store it using the second register’s qudits [17].
We want to calculate the eigenvalue of |u〉 where U|u〉  e2πir |u〉
by estimating the phase factor r.
The following derivations follow those in Ref. 26. For
convenience, we rewrite the rational number r as

For convenience, we write an integer j in a base-d form. If j > 1
then

j  j1 j2 /jn  j1 dn−1 + jn−2

Qudits and High-Dimensional Quantum Computing

exponentially as the qudit dimension increases [129]. A long list
of PEA applications includes Shor’s factorization algorithm [142];
simulation of quantum systems [1]; solving linear equations [69,
128]; and quantum counting [147]. To give some examples, a
quantum simulator utilizing the PEA algorithm has been used to
calculate the molecular ground-state energies [8] and to obtain
the energy spectra of molecular systems [13, 41, 42, 84, 154].
Recently, a method to solve the linear system using a qutrit
version of the PEA has been proposed [138]. The qudit version of
the PEA opens the possibility to realize all those applications that
have the potential to out-perform their qubit counterparts.
Shor’s quantum algorithm for prime factorization gives an
important example of super-polynomial speed-up offered by a
quantum algorithm over the currently-available classical
algorithms for the same purpose [143]. The order-ﬁnding
algorithm at the core of the factoring algorithm is a direct
application of the PEA. With the previous discussion on the
qudit versions of the quantum Fourier transform and phase
estimation, we have the foundation to generalize Shor’s
factoring algorithm to the higher dimensional qudit system.
Several proposals for performing Shor’s algorithm on the qudit
system, such as the adiabatic quantum algorithm of two qudits for
factorization [166]; exist. This method makes use of a timedependent effective Hamiltonian in the form of a sequence of
rotation operators that are selected accoding to the qudit’s
transitions between its neighboring levels.
Another proposal carries out a computational resource
analysis on two quantum ternary platforms [17]. One is the
“generic” platform that uses magic state distillation for
universality [25]. The other, known as a metaplectic
topological quantum computer (MTQC), is a non-Abelian
anyonic platform, where anyonic braiding and interferomic
measurement is used to achieved the universality with a
relatively low cost [37, 38]. The article discusses two different
logical solutions for Shor’s period-ﬁnding function on each of the
two platforms: one that encodes the integers with the binary
subspace of the ternary state space and optimizes the known
binary arithmetic circuits; the other encodes the integer directly
in the ternary space using the arithmetic circuits stemming in Ref.
16. Signiﬁcant advantages for the MTQC platform are found
compared to the others. In particular the MTQC platform can
factorize an n-bit number with n + 7 logical qutrits with the price
of a larger circuit-depth. To sum up the comparison, the MTQC
provides signiﬁcant ﬂexibility at the period ﬁnding algorithm for
the ternary quantum computers.

Grover’s quantum search with qudits have been proposed,
such as one that uses the discrete Fourier transform as an
alternative to the Hadamard gate [54] or another
d-dimensional transformation [101] for the construction of
the reﬂection-about-average operator (also known as the
diffusion operator). In this section, an instruction on setting
up Grover’s algorithm in the qudit system is reviewed as well as
a proposal of a new way to build a quantum gate F that can
generate an equal-weight superposition state from a single
qudit state [79]. With the new gate F, it is easier to realize
Grover’s algorithm in a physical system and improve the overall
efﬁciency of the circuit.
Grover’s algorithm solves the unstructured search problem
by applying Grover’s oracle iteratively as shown in
Figure 12B. To construct the oracle, we build qudit gates
to perform the oracle function f (x) that acts differently on the
search target s as compared to all the others. The logic behind
the algorithm is to amplify the amplitude of the marked state
|s〉 with the oracle function, while attenuating the amplitudes
of all the other states.
The marked state is ampliﬁed enough to
√
be located in O( N ) steps for an N dimensional search space.
In each step Grover’s oracle is executed one time. This oracle
can be broken into two parts: (1) Oracle query. The oracle
shifts the phase of the marked state |s〉 and leaving others
unchanged by doing
Rs ϕs   1 + eiϕs − 1|s〉〈s|.

(2) Reﬂection-about-average. This operation is a reﬂection about a
vector |a〉 with a phase ϕa :
Ra ϕa   1 + eiϕa − 1|a〉〈a|.

(107)

It is constructed by applying the generalized Hadamard gate H,
applying phase shift to |0〉 state and then applying H again. It is
straightforward to show that
H ⊗n R0 ϕa H ⊗n  Ra ϕa .
The two steps combined form Grover’s operator G, which is one
execute of Grover’s iteration. This process of Grover’s iteration G
is shown in Figure 12A.
Building Grover’s operator in a qudit system can be simpliﬁed
both algorithmically and physically. The most important
improvement can be achieved by replacing the Hadamard gate
H with F which drives the single-qudit state |0k 〉 into an equal
weight superposition state,

3.3 Quantum Search Algorithm With Qudits

The quantum search algorithm, also known as Grover’s
algorithm, is one of the most important quantum algorithms
that illustrates the advantage of quantum computing. Grover’s
algorithm is able to outperform the classical search algorithm for
a large database. The size of the computational space in an
n-qubit system is a Hilbert space of 2n dimensions.
Since there is a practical limit for the number of working
qubits, the working Hilbert space can be expanded by
increasing the dimension of each carrier of information,
i.e., using qudits and qudit gates. Several schemes of

Qudits and High-Dimensional Quantum Computing

adiabatic condition, into a close approximation of the ground
state of the Hamiltonian specifying the problem [55]. The
advantage of adiabatic quantum computing is evident in its
natural correspondence to quantizing satisﬁability problems
[55]; and current efforts to exploit adiabatic quantum
computing focus on quantum annealing, which is a quantum
generalization of the simulated annealing metaheuristic used for
non-quantum global optimization problems [40, 56, 83].
Quantum annealing is an important branch of quantum
computing, particularly at the commercial level exempliﬁed by
D-Wave’s early and continuing work in this domain. As D-Wave
researchers themselves point out, realistic solid-state devices
treated as qubits are not actually two-level systems and
higher-dimensional representations of the dynamics must be
considered to model and simulate realistic solid-state quantum
annealers. The effect of states outside the qubit space, namely the
treatment of solid-state quantum annealing as qudit dynamics,
has been studied carefully with conditions established for
soundness of qubit approximations [5].
In fact the qudit nature of so-called superconduting qubits,
i.e., the higher-dimensional aspects of the objects serving as
qubits, is not just a negative feature manifesting as leakage
error; remarkable two-qubit gate performance is achieved by
exploiting adiabatic evolution involving avoided crossings with
higher levels [10, 110] with this exploitation for fast, high-ﬁdelity
quantum gates extendable to three-qubit gates and beyond by
exploiting intermediate qudit dynamics and avoided level
crossings [160, 161]. Another suggestion for exploiting qudit
dynamics concerns using a degenerate two-level system with the
additional freedom perhaps improving the energy gap and thus
increasing success probability [156].
A dearth of studies have taken place to date into qudit-based
adiabatic quantum computing. The one proposal thus far
concerns a quantum adiabatic algorithm for factorization on
two qudits [166]. Speciﬁcally, they consider two qudits of
possibly different dimensions, thus necessitating a hybrid twoqudit gate [39]. They propose a time-dependent effective
Hamiltonian to realize this two-qudit gate and its realization
as radio-frequency magnetic ﬁeld pulses. For this model, they
simulate factorization of each of the numbers 35, 21, and 15 for
two quadrupole nuclei with spins 3/2 and 1, respectively,
corresponding to qudit dimensions of 4 and 3, respectively.

Then from the two-state solution, we can calculate the dynamics
of the multipod [97].
This method of building F minimizes the number and the
duration of algorithmic steps and thus is fast to implement and, in
addition, it also provides better protection against detrimental
effects such as decoherence or imperfections. Due to its
conceptual simplicity, this method has applications in
numerous physical systems. Thus, it is one of the most natural
and simplest realizations of Grover’s algorithm in qudits.

4 ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF QUANTUM
COMPUTING WITH QUDITS
The gate-based description of quantum computing is useful to
establish principles of quantum computing with qudits, similar to
the case for qubits. There are various approaches to quantum
computing besides the gate-based model, such as the
measurement-based [134]; adiabatic quantum computing [3,
55] and topological quantum computing [57]. Qudit versions
of these approaches are barely explored to date, and we
summarize the current status of these studies below.

4.1 Measurement-Based Qudit Computing
Measurement-based quantum computing was introduced as an
alternative approach to quantum computing whereby a highly
entangled state, such as a cluster state [22] or its graph-state
generalization [70]; is prepared and then computation is
performed by sequential single-qubit measurements in bases
that are determined by a constant number of previous
measurement outcomes [123, 134]. Measurement-based
quantum computing is appealing in settings where preparing a
highly entangled many-qubit graph state is feasible, such as
parallelized controlled-phase operations [134] or cooling to the
ground-state of a special Hamiltonian [123].
Measurement-based qudit quantum computing is unexplored to
date. Preparatory work on generalizing graph states, implicitly
including the cluster-state special case, to qudit graph states has
been reported [85]. Regarding implement, qudit-based approaches
have only been reported for the error-correction aspect of
measurement-based qubit quantum computing [82]. In this
approach, the cluster state is envisioned as comprising qudits, with
the high-dimensional nature of qudits serving to encode qubits for
error correction. They propose continuous-variable realizations of a
qudit cluster state in a continuous-variable setting [82].

4.3 Topological Quantum Computing With
Qudits
Topological quantum computing offers advantages over other
forms of quantum computing by reducing quantum error
correction overheads by exploiting topological protection. Some
work has been done on topological quantum computing with qudits
by proposing quantum computing with parafermions [49, 74].
Majorana fermions are expected to exhibit non-abelian
statistics, which makes these exotic particles, or their
quasiparticle analogue, sought after for anyonic quantum
computing [90]. Majorana fermions can be generalized to Zd
parafermions, which also exhibit non-abelian statistics and
reduce to standard Majorana fermions for d  2. One advantage

4.2 Adiabatic Qudit Computing
Adiabatic quantum computing approaches quantum computing
by encoding the solution of a computational problem as the
ground-state of a Hamiltonian whose description is readily
obtained; the solution is obtained by preparing the ground
state of a Hamiltonian whose ground-state is efﬁciently
constructed and then evolving slowly, according to the

of d > 2 is that parafermion braiding is an entangling operation.
Importantly, encoding a qudit of dimension d in the fourparafermion fusion space enables all single-qudit Clifford gates
to be generated modulo phase terms [74].
Clifford gates do not provide a universal set of gates for
quantum computing. A non-Clifford gate can be achieved for
parafermions encoded into parafermion zero modes by exploiting
the Aharonov-Casher effect, physically implemented by move a
half-ﬂuxon around the parafermionic zero modes. Combining
this non-Clifford gate with the Clifford gates achieved by
parafermion braiding yields a universal gate set of non-abelian
quantum computing with qudits [49].

Here we review a single photon system that has demonstrated a
proof-of-principle qutrit PEA [106]. In a photonic system, there is
no deterministic way to interact two photons and thus it is hard to
build a reliable controlled gate for the photonic qudits. The
following photonic system bypasses this difﬁculty via using the
two degrees of freedom on a single photon—i.e., the time-bin and
frequency-bin to be the two qutrits. The frequency degree of
freedom carries one qutrit as the control register and the time
degree of freedom carries another qutrit as the target register. The
experimental apparatus consists of the well-established techniques
and ﬁber-optic components: continuous-wave (CW) laser source,
phase modulator (PM), pulse shaper (PS), intensity modulator
(IM) and chirped ﬁber Bragg grating (CFBG). The device is divided
into three parts [106]: 1) A state preparation part that comprises a
PM followed by a PS and a IM that encodes the initial state to
qudits; 2) a controlled-gate part that is built with a PM sandwiched
by two CFBGs to perform the control-U operation; and 3) an
inverse Fourier transformation comprising a PM and then a PS to
extract the phase information. Note that the controlled-gate part
can perform a multi-value-controlled gate that applies different
operations based on the three unique states of the control qutrit. In
the PEA procedure, eigenphases can be retrieved with 98% ﬁdelity.
In addition to having long coherence lifetime, the photonic system
also has a unique advantage over other common quantum devices,
i.e., the ability to process and measure thousands of photons
simultaneously. This allows us to generate statistical patterns
quickly and infer the phase accurately whereas the normal PEA
has to use additional qudits on the control register to increase
accuracy.
Here we provide an example for the statistical inference of the
phase based on numerical data generated by the photonic PEA
experiment just described. The two unitary operations used in the
experimental setup are

5 IMPLEMENTATIONS OF QUDITS AND
ALGORITHMS
The qubit circuit and qubit algorithm have been implemented on
various physical systems such as defects in solids [27, 81, 120];
quantum dots [104, 127]; photons [113, 132]; super conducting
systems [29, 31]; trapped ions [14, 15]; magnetic [7, 18, 32, 148]
and non-magnetic molecules [30, 152]. For each physical
representation of the qubit, only two levels of states are used
to store and process quantum information. However, many
quantum properties of these physical systems have more than
two levels, such as the frequency of the photon [106]; energy
levels of the trapped ions [91]; spin states of the nuclear magnetic
resonance systems [48] and the spin state of the molecular
magnetic magnets [115]. Therefore, these systems have the
potential to represent qudit systems. In this section, we brieﬂy
review several physical platforms that have been used to
implement qudit gates or qudit algorithms.
Although most of the systems have three or four levels
available for computation, they are extensible to higher level
systems and scalable to multi-qudit interactions. These pioneer
implementations of qudit systems show the potential of future
realization of the more powerful qudit quantum computers that
have real-life applications.

In the experiment, photonic qutrits are sent through the control
and target registers and the state of the control register qutrits is
measured and counted to obtain the phase information.

the probability for the qutrit output state to fell into \ketn, where
n ∈ {0, 1, 2}, is

5.1 Time and Frequency Bin of a photon
Photonic system is a good candidate for quantum computing
because photons rarely interact with other particles and thus
have a comparatively long decoherence time. In addition,
photon has many quantum properties such as the orbital
angular momentum [9, 52]; frequency-bin [75, 76, 96, 107] and
time-bin [73, 78] that can be used to represent a qudit. Each of
these properties provides an extra degrees of freedom for the
manipulation and computation. Each degree of freedom usually
has dimensions greater than two and thus can be used as a unique
qudit. The experimental realization of arbitrary multidimensional
multiphotonic transformations has been proposed with the help of
ancilla state, which is achievable via the introduction of a new
quantum nondemolition measurement and the exploitation of a
genuine high-dimensional interferometer [60]. Experimental
entanglement of high-dimensional qudits, where multiple highpurity frequency modes of the photons are in a superposition
coherently, is also developed and demonstrated [96].

Qudits and High-Dimensional Quantum Computing

This evolution operator can perform all kinds of the required
coherent operations that are acting on any two of the logical
states. It operates on the system and works essentially as a single
qutrit gate. All kinds of transitions can be realized by
manipulating the κ and κ′ coupling. Therefore with the proper
manipulation of the parameters κ and κ′ we are able to perform
any arbitrary one-qutrit gate as desired.
Single qutrit gate alone is not sufﬁcient to form a universal
computational set, as we need a conditional two-qutrit gate or a
two-qutirt controlled-gate to achieve universality. To deﬁne the
conditional two-qutrit gate we need an auxiliary level |0’〉 as
shown in Figure 14. The conditional two-qutrit gate is achievable
via the center-of-mass (CM) motion of ions inside
 the trap. The
ion CM coupled to the electronic transition |0〉 → q〉 is described
by the Hamiltonian

eigenvector and gives the eigenvalue. The second experiment with
U2 estimates the phase of a state with an arbitrary value (not a
fraction of π), but, by repeating the experiment, the eigenvalue can be
estimated from the statistical distribution of the results.

5.2 Ion Trap
Intrinsic spin, an exclusively quantum property, has an inherently
ﬁnite discrete state space which is a perfect choice for
representing qubit or qudit. When a charged particle has spin,
it possess a magnetic momentum and is controllable by external
electromagneic pulses. This concept leads to the idea of ion trap
where a set of charged ions are conﬁned by electromagnetic ﬁeld.
The hyperﬁne (nuclear spin) state of an atom, and lowest level
vibrational modes (phonons) of the trapped atoms serves as good
representations of the qudits. The individual state of an atom is
manipulated with laser pulse and the ions interact with each other
via a shared phonon state.
The set-up of an ion trap qutrit system reviewed here can
perform arbitrary single qutrit gates and a control-not gate [91].
These two kinds of gates form a universal set and thus can be
combined to perform various quantum algorithms such as those
discussed in Section 3. The electronic levels of an ion are shown in
Figure 14. The energy levels |0〉, |1〉, |2〉 are used to store the
quantum information of a qutrit. The transition between the levels
are driven by the classical ﬁelds Ω03 , Ω13 , Ω04 , and Ω24 of the Raman
transitions through independent channels linked to orthogonal
polarizations. We ﬁrst develop a system acting as a single qutrit
gate that can manipulate the energy levels of the ion via Raman
transitions driven by the classical ﬁelds. The following expressions
follow those in Ref. 91. For single qutrit gates, where the center-ofmass motion is excluded, we can include the spatial dependence of
the Raman ﬁelds as phase factors Δ and assuming the conditions
Δ ≫ Ω04 , Ω03 , Ω31 , Ω42 ,

Hn,q 

This Hamiltonian governs the coherent interaction between
qutrits and collective CM motion. With appropriate selection
of effective interaction time and laser polarizations, the CM
motion coupled to electronic transitions is coherently
manipulated [91].
To complete the universal quantum computation requirements,
we need to develop a measurement scheme. In this scheme, von
Neumann measurements distinguishing three directions |0〉, |1〉,
|2〉 are made possible via the resonant interactions from |1〉 and
|2〉 to states |3〉 and |4〉, respectively. The single and two-qutrit
controlled gate are combined to perform various qutrit algorithms
such as the quantum Fourier transform. Other variations of the
ion-trap qutrit quantum computer designs use trapped ions in the
presence of a magnetic ﬁeld gradient [111]. The qutrit ion-trap
computer provides a signiﬁcant increase of the available Hilbert
space while demanding only the same amount of physical
resources.

5.3 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is an essential tool in
chemistry and involves manipulating and detecting molecules’
nuclear spin states using radio-frequency electromagnetic waves
[19]. Some technologies of this ﬁeld are sophisticated enough to
control and observe thousands of nuclei in an experiment. The
NMR has the potential to scale up quantum computer to
thousands of qudits [144].
In this section we review the implementation of a single-qudit
algorithm that can determine the parity of a permutation on an
NMR system [48]. The algorithm itself is the parity determining
algorithm explained in Section 3.1.1. The molecule in this NMR
setup is embedded in a liquid crystalline environment and the
strong magnetic ﬁeld is used to adjust the anisotropic molecular

molecules, which have a long life-time, are used to store the
quantum information. This information is read out by the
electronic states. In the mean time, the robustness of the
molecule allows it to conserve its molecular, electronic and
magnetic characteristics at high temperatures [116].
As one of the SMMs, the single molecule TbPc2 complex
reviewed in this section possesses all necessary properties such as
long lifetime and robustness. These properties are integrated as
important components of a serious quantum mechanical devices, for
examples, resonator [59]; molecular spin valve [149] and transistor
[138, 146]. TbPc2 gains its SMM properties from the strong
spinâ€“orbit coupling of lanthanide ions and the ligand ﬁeld [77].
Magnetic properties of TbPc2 are governed by the Hamiltonian:

orientation. This adding a ﬁnite quadrupolar coupling term to the
Hamiltonian which is as follows
H  −ω0 Iz + Λ 3Iz2 − I 2 ,

(122)

where Λ  e2 qQS/4 is the effective value of the quadrupolar
coupling [48]. The Fourier transformation is implemented by
a sequence of three transition-selective pulses. A series of
combinations of 180+ pulses, both transition-selective and
non-selective, is used to implement the permutations.
Final states of the system can be derived from a single projective
measurement. Pseudopure spin states act as approximation of
effect of the system on an ensemble NMR quantum computer
since it is impossible to do the true projective measurements [98].

represents the Zeeman energy. Ahf I · J accounts for hyperﬁne

sweeping magnetic ﬁeld associated with mI  ± 12 and ± 32 can
cause quantum tunneling of magnetization, which preserves
nuclear spin while changing electronic magnetic moment. This
ﬁeld enables nuclear-spin measurement by suspending the TbPc2
molecule on carbon nanotubes (CNT) and between gold junctions.
This measurement uses the technique of electro-migration.

coherence times are important aspects to be analyzed for the
TbPc2 system, and this process is accomplished by imaging the
initialized nuclear spin trajectory in real-time.
Statistical analysis of the nuclear spin coherence time makes use
of the spinâ€“lattice relaxation times by ﬁtting the data for an

and experimentally obtained density matrices. Fidelities obtained
for these proposed operations are 0.92 and above.
Another set-up of the same algorithm treats a single quart

nuclei, which is commonly selected for NMR-QIP applications.
In their NMR systems the four energy levels needed is made via
the Zeeman splitting using a strong static magnetic ﬁeld. All of the
two implementations of the single-qudit algorithm show that the
NMR system provides a way to realize a reliable and efﬁcient
qudit system for the quantum computing.

qudits [115]. They have phenomenal magnetic characteristics
and can be manipulated via chemical means. This enables the

interaction between the SMM with the other units. As pointed

6 SUMMARY AND FUTURE OUTLOOK OF
QUDIT SYSTEM

qudits is more advantageous if the qudits are entangled. The
entanglement becomes more robust by increasing the dimension
of the qudits while ﬁxing their numbers. In other words, as the
noise sources act locally on every system, increasing the
dimension d will reduce the number of systems and thus
reduce the effect of noise resulting in the robustness increase
[103]. The increasing noise level tolerance as the qudit dimension
increases can be shown on an photonic OAM system as an
example of its implementation [51].
In summary the qudit system possesses advantages in the
circuit design, physical implementation and has the potential to
outperform the qubit system in various applications.

6.1 Summary of the Advantages of Qudit
Systems Compared to Qubit Systems
Throughout the article we discuss and review many aspects of the
qudit systems such as qudit gates, qudit algorithms, alternative
computation models and implementations. Most gates and
algorithms based on qudits have some advantages over those
for qubits, such as shorter computational time, lower requirement
of resources, higher availability, and the ability to solve more
complex problems. The qudit system, with its high-dimensional
nature, can provide more degrees of freedom and larger
computational space. This section summarizes the advantages
of the qudit system compared to the qubit system.
Qudit gates have the advantage of a larger working Hilbert space
which reduces the number of qudits needed to represent an
arbitrary unitary matrix. In our discussion of universality in
Section 2.1.2, the qudit method proposed by Muthukrishnan
and Stroud’s has a (log2 d)2 scaling advantage over the qubit
case. Furthermore, Luo and Wang show that with their
proposed universal computation scheme [108]; there is an extra
factor of n reduction in the gate requirement, where n is the number
of qudits. By introducing qudits to the construction of some wellknown gates such as the Toffoli gate, the elementary gate required
are reduced from 12n − 11 gates in the qubit case to 2n − 1 gates by
introducing a single (n + 1)-level target carrier [133] and to 2n − 3
gates by utilizing the topological properties [89]. In our discussion
of the geometrically quantiﬁed qudit-gate efﬁciency in Section 2.3,
the qubit system needs O(n6 d(I, U)3 ) one- and two-qubit gates to
synthesize a unitary [122] while in the qutrit case the lower bound is
O(nk d(I, U)3 ) where k is an integer that depends on the accuracy
of the approximation and can be smaller than 6 [100].
For many of the physical systems such as photons [113, 132];
super conducting systems [29, 31]; trapped ions [14, 15]; magnetic
[7, 18, 32, 148] and non-magnetic molecules [30, 152] there are
usually more than two available physical states available for the
applications. The qudit system has a higher efﬁciency utilizing those
extra states than the qubit system. Also using the photonic system,
we can perform the multi-level controlled gate (Section 2.2) which
can perform multiple control operations at and same time and
largely reduce the number of controlled gates requirement [106].
Other than computation, the qudit also has advantages in
quantum communication as it possesses a higher noise resilience
than the qubit [36]. The qudit system has a higher quantum bit
error rate (QBER), which is a measure of resistance to the
environmental noise or eavesdropping attacks, compared to
the qubit system. The higher noise tolerance of the qudits
helps to increase the secret key rate as it can be shown that
the secret key rate increases as the Hilbert space dimensions
increase at the same noise level [140]. Notice that in practical
situation, the qudit system performed on each particular physical
apparatus has varied amount of advantages than the qubit and
there might be cases in which the high-dimensional states have a
higher transmission distance [36]. This higher noise resilience of

6.2 Future Outlook of Qudit System
This review article introduces the basics of the high-dimensional
qudit systems and provides details about qudit gates, qudit
algorithms and implementations on various physical systems.
The article serves as a summary of recent developments of qudit
quantum computing and an introduction for newcomers to the
ﬁeld of qudit quantum computing. Furthermore we show the
advantages and the potential for qudit systems to outperform
qubit counterparts. Of course these advantages can come with
challenges such as possibly harder-to-implement universal gates,
benchmarking [80, 94, 117]; characterization of qudit gate [68,
136] and error correction connected with the complexity of the
Clifford hierarchy for qudits [157].
Compared to qubit systems, qudit systems currently have
received less attention in both theoretical and experimental
studies. However, qudit quantum computing is becoming
increasingly important as many topics and problems in this
ﬁeld are ripe for exploration. Extending from qubits to qudits
uses in some mathematical challenges, with these mathematical
problems elegant and perhaps giving new insights into quantum
computing in their own right. Connections between quantum
resources such as entanglement, quantum algorithms and their
improvements, scaling up qudit systems both to higher
dimension and to more particles, benchmarking and error
correction, and the bridging between qudits and continuousvariable quantum computing [67] are examples of the fantastic
research directions in this ﬁeld of high-dimensional quantum
computing.
